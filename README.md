### Developing e-commerce recommender system using the following techniques:

#### For collaborative filtering:
1) Matrix Factorization
2) NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering)
3) RNN for Sequential Recommendation
4) Hybrid NCF + RNN
5) Graphs Network


#### Traditional statistical techniques:
1) Cosine similarity (btr than euclidean because it cares more about patterns rather than magnitude)
2) Euclidean Distance


#### For cold-start:
1) TF-IDF (looking at item's description and comparing)
2) Bag of Words
3) KNN
4) Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)


Some misc knowledge:
Bayesian average to rank items with ratings + counts instead of just looking at their ratings.
Because items with 5 star ratings with only 2 ratings are not actually v popular vs an item with 4.5 star but 100+ ratings.
